# AssignmentTwo
Intermediate Mobile Apps Assignment Two

For this assignment, you will need to create a total of four custom controls, two Entry renderers and two Editor Renderers
You will need to create one Entry renderer and one Editor renderer for each platform.
Each of the controls (entry and editor) should have a derived class in the Xamarin Forms project that you will use as your Forms class that will appear in the XAML, just like we did in class.
The idea is to make a text editor (with very limited functionality)
The first custom renderer should be the title control with a large, title-sized font.  This should be your Entry renderer.  On iOS you can set the font using "Control.Font = UIFont.FromName("TrebuchetMS", 22);"
On Android, you can set the font using Control.FontSize.
The title control should have blue text on iOS and green text on Android.  While the body text should be dark gray on both platforms.
The second control will be the Editor control, which is basically a multiline edit control.  This control should take up all the available space below the title and have a much smaller font.
All of the controls should have a solid line style border.  The project we did in class had this.

I recorded the project we did in class, it is available here:

That's it!  This is a 30 point assignment.

Due March 29th.

Happy Coding!
